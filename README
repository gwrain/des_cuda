!!!This is only support 64bit linux system with cuda!!!

build:
    make

use:
    encrypt:
    ./des -k keyfile -o outputfile sourcefile
    decrypt:
    ./des -k keyfile -d -o outputfile sourcefile

    keyfile:
    is a plain text file,
    for example keyfile's content is "1234567812345678"
    that is a 64bit num which is 0x1234567812345678

    if you want to use gpu to accelerate speed;
    you can use --gpu switches;
    for example:

    ./des -k keyfile --gpu -o outputfile sourcefile
    ./des -k keyfile --gpu -d -o outputfile sourcefile

    on my machine when use cpu the speed is almost 500KB/s.
    but when use gpu the speed is up to 4MB/s.
    
    infact there still spaces to speedup.
